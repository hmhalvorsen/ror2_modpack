# Alternate Huntress Skin

Adds a model swap as a skin, with both of her vanilla skins as options.
Such changes to the model are:
- Removal of the scarf
- Removal of the chest armor
- Addition of a mini jacket
- Visor change
- Addition of clawed boots
- Increased... thickness of the waist down (Thus making it NSFW)

A version with the vanilla helmet is available, use the config to change it.
(Launch the game first to generate the config, restart for it to take effect.)

# Changelog
- 1.1.0: Added a default helmet version for both skins.
- 1.2.0: Removed the chest armor.
- 1.2.1: Added a config to decide which variation of the skins to load to prevent the skin list from being bloated. Included 
versions with the scarf equipped. Launch the game first to generate the config.
- 1.3.0: Added a mini jacket to wear. Switched shader. Scarf no longer an option in the config due to clipping issues, 
will add it later. "Enhanced" the body even further. New model for the bow.
- 1.3.1: Fixed (Maybe?) the chance where the game would crash when teleporting at the end of a stage.
- 1.3.2: No longer broken from update.
- 1.3.3: Fixed materials being bugged from the update.

# Known Issues
- On the character selection menu, the vanilla bow will have the mesh swap. In-game it will have its vanilla mesh.
