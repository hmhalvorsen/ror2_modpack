# Risque Fem Commando Skin
Adds a lewd skin complete with jiggle physics. Comes with additional skins, with familiar color palettes. Individual skins can be enabled or disabled in the config.
And yes, this looks similar to another skin I made, this one has a body model that is higher quality and made entirely from scratch.
Comes with optional guns, which can be chosen in the config.
Other than the default pistol, the choices are:
- 7th Seraph Officer Revolver
- FMG-9
- MP5K
- PDW-57
- PM-9
- RSH-12
- PP2000
- MK23 SOCOM
- CBJ-MS
- K7
- Chicom CQB
