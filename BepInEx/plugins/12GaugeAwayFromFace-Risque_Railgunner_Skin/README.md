# Risque Railgunner Skin
Adds a lewd skin complete with jiggle physics, based on the original work of MPookums. Comes with an additional skin, too based on the artist's fan art.
Based on the artist's request, concept art will not be provided, go ask her for it.

# Preview
Sorry! No embedded pictures! Need to keep it clean for the Thunderstore. (Honestly it should be okay, but just in case since it's an NSFW mod) Click the link below for the preview.

# To Do
- Monsoon style skin. That comes much later though.

# Modder's Notes
- I absolutely hate Railgunner's armature, there's only so much I can do with its jank.
- I spent much longer than I should have on this.
