# SFW Alternate Huntress Skin

Adds a model swap as a skin, with both of her vanilla skins as options.
Such changes to the model are:
- Removal of the scarf
- Removal of the chest armor
- Addition of a mini jacket
- Visor change
- Addition of clawed boots

A version with the vanilla helmet is available, use the config to change it.
(Launch the game first to generate the config, restart for it to take effect.)

As stated above, this is the SFW version. NSFW version can be found here:
