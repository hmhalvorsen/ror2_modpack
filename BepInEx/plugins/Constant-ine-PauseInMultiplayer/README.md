#PauseInMultiplayer

I mean, it's pretty self explanatory. Have a break!

##Features
The server's host now has the ability to pause the game!

**How-to:**:
Simply type `plspause` in the chat and everything will freeze. Then again to unpause.

##About
The mod simulates a 'pause' in multiplayer by freezing the timer, the mob spawning and all the monster's animators while also making them invulnurable in that frozen state.
