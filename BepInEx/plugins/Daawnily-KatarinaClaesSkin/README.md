## Mod Overview

Adds Katarina Claes (Main heroine of My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!) skin for the most chuuni of classes - Mercenary. 
This mod was initially made for very personal use and as such, is really rough around the edges - however, now after going a mild case of skin peeling by Mr.Bones it's significantly better!

## Known Issues
- Underskirt peeks through the skirt. As far as I'm aware it's not possible to fix due to how the model is, as well as how dynamic bones works.
- Funky dynamic bones look when you fall from really high up and look in a specific, uncalled for way, I KNOW what you tried to do.

## To do
- Figure out how to make the swings red for extra 50% more chuuni.

- Thanks to the community for making plenty of guides on how to create skins, especial thanks to KingEnderBrine for making RoRSkinBuilder.

- Thanks to Mr.Bones (Discord : Mr.Bones#6812) for accepting my commission to make this skin better. I think he did a great job, considering that this model initially was never meant to be used in any way shape or form for active movement.

Also, if anyone is familiar with the process of making ghost projectiles for mercenary red - please hit me up at Daawnily#5040 - that is the last thing this skin needs!
