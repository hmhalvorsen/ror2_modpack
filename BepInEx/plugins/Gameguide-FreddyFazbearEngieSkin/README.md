## To-Do

- ~~Replace grenade projectiles once I figure out how~~
- ~~None Fnaf is now real.~~
- ~~Unless new ideas arise or something breaks thats all for Fnaf Engie :)~~
- ~~Don't worry Fnaf is still real~~
- ~~Potentially add more Fnaf characters to other Survivors (might be a while don't bank on it)~~
- ~~Optimize models~~ (only saved ~3 MBS worth of space with quality loss didn't feel very worth it)
- ~~Fix up models (probably not I enjoy the goofy look | also depends on what others think of the goofy look)~~
- Also yes thats it for ROR2 Fnaf skins until further notice from me I hope you all have fun at the party :) (weight painting is sickening)
- Keep mod updated
