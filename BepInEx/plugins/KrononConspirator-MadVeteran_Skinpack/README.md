### Concept

The Mindset i went into Making this was "realizing Survivor's Meta as Skins" but take that idea but do it proper.
so what i got going on is:

| Survivor     | Meta     | Theme | Skin actulization |
|--------------|----------|-------|-------------------|
|Engineer|BUNGUS BUNGUS BU..|Bungus-Infested |"B.Fungus experiment gone wrong"|
|Captain|haha Diablo go Brr|Going Nuclear|"Soldier in the Old War built for Devastation"|
|Artificer|Stun [The End]|Ice Witch|"Technomancer? Nah imma make magic real" + "a Certain Bringer for the age of stars"|
|Commando|Proc Machine|Super soldier|"I Need a Weapon"|
|Railgunner|Knockback Air Control|Flight| "Air Force Jordans" + "USAF Pilot"|
|Mul-T|Minigun Supreme/High Speed Sniper|Machine Of War| "Arcade classic with a Tank" |
|Void Fiend|Full Corruption/Full Base Heal|Engulfed in Void| “In his house at R’lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.” |
|Huntress|Crowbar stacks|Half-Life| "Valve E-girl" |
|Acrid|Deathmark|Plague rat| "Moon Knight" + "Just A rat" + "one of the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse" |
|Rex|Life Drain| Plant And Machines |"Wall-E Plant Revolution"|
|Loader|THE Melee Exclusive|Runebound Boxer|"Big Arms" + "Big Lady" + "Bunch of Crystals"|
|(WIP) Merc|Slicing Wind + Expose|Cyborg with a sword|-|
|(?) Bandit|Purity + Desperado + Ratio-ed|Cleansed|-|
