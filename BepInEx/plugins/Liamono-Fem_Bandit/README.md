# Fem Bandit (prototype)
Adds a fem bandit skin.  I'm a bit dissappointed by how this one turned out, especially with how much harder it's been lol. Had to make that fix script with no prior knowledge of python, and don't even get me started on the mysterious case of the invisible belt mesh lol. I'm taking a break from it as it's been a frustrating endeavor with lackluster results.

# Thoughts
Honestly not sure if it'd be worth working on or polishing this design further. No matter what I try, I cannot seem to bring out that same 'oomph' as my other skins. I think part of the problem is with the bandit's actual design, maybe that wild west gunslinger aesthetic doesn't translate well to a fem version (whereas Commando and Merc aesthetic looks great on a female). I have a feeling a truly great Fem Bandit will need a different aesthetic, but that'd require a lot more creativity than I'm used to.

# Changelog
- 0.5.0: added

# Known Issues
- Items won't be positioned/sized perfectly on the body when using the fem skin (duh). Don't panic, it's just cosmetic.
- I noticed that some of the meshes don't switch back when you switch to the vanilla skin, but like other similar cases, it's only temporary and goes away as soon as you start a game or switch characters.
