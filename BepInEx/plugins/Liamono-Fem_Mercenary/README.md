# Fem Mercenary (1.2)
Adds 2 fem skins to mercenary, now no longer dependent on EnigmaticThunder. Should be compatible with just about everything (at least until the next RoR2 update). Polished AF, looks like it came straight from the devs themselves. I have figured out how to make the mastery requirement work, but I haven't implemented it yet. That means you'll still have the fem Oni unlocked by default. For now.

# Todo
- implement mastery requirements once I've made sure they're safe via playtesting. Don't wanna wipe anyone's save lol.

Send me feedback on discord plz (Liamono#1206).

# Known Issues
- Items won't be positioned/sized perfectly on the body when using the skins (duh). Don't worry, it's just cosmetic.
- The female Oni will be unlocked even if you don't have Mercenary:Mastery. Don't worry, it doesn't affect your achievements or anything else. But you won't use the Oni if you haven't earned it, right? Have some honor plz.
