- 1.1.0: Added config file with setting "Use Default Sword". Fem paladin skin will use the claymore sword if false. If set to true, then it will use the default sword. False by default.
- 1.2.0: Made the script more robust. Compatible with PaladinMod 1.4.13 as well as previous versions, and should be more future-proof than ever. Also works with cape as a side effect (HA!).
- 1.3.0: Now dependent on the Paladin_Alliance version of PaladinMod.



# Known Issues
- Items won't be positioned/sized perfectly on the body when using the skin (duh). Don't worry, it's just cosmetic.
- Although the "specified version" of bepinex for this mod says 5.4.9, it should work just fine with bepinex 5.3.1. Should also be compatible with future and past versions of PaladinMod (for real this time).
