# About
Original skin by [Sakasama-san](https://thunderstore.io/package/Sakasama-san/SakasamaSkins/), I removed the RyanSkinApi dependency and adjusted some things to try and make it as similar as possible to the original (huntress is the one who's more different than the others, I still don't know why).
Got asked to do it in the RoR2 Modding Discord Server

# Original description:
I hate how little variety there is when it comes to choosing Skins, so I decided
I should make some I aim to make atleast 3 Skins for each Survivor in the game.
