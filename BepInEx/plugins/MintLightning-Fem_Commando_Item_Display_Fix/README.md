# Fem Commando Item Display Fix
- This mod changes how items are displayed on Commando to fit Liamono's 'Fem Commando' model.
- This is an all-or-nothing mod, meaning that if you want to go back to the normal item display you'll have to disable it. I'm sure there's a way to make the ItemDisplay switch automatically but I don't know how to do that.

# Todo
- Make the ItemDisplay swap out automatically when choosing which skin to use (I'm not going to do this, but if anyone wants to figure it out and let me know, go for it).
