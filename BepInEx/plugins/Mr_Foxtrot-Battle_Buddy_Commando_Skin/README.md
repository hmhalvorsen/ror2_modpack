# Battle Buddy Commando

A personal skin mod for Commando that ports the "Battle Buddy" from my own WIP game "Foxtrot's Awesome Intense Looter Shooter".
The skin is titled "Vessel" in the skin list.

Weight painting isn't perfect, since this skin was to test out the skinbuilder but mostly works just fine.
So uh, enjoy I guess lol.
