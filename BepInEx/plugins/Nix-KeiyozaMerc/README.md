## Mod Overview
A comission for A_Delicious_Cod. This mod changes the mercenaries appereance to Keiyoza from a character originally made by [KAYOZIA](https://twitter.com/kayozia) proper credits below. It has a lot of physics bones so dont expect it to be clipping free but for the most part it should looks good in motion!

<strong>UPDATE due to popular request added tailless version of the skin!
