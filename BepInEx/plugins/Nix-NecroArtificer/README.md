## Mod Overview
Adds a necromancer skin for artificer based off a reference image in the credits, modeling texturing etc all done by me
Very rough when it coems to the flowing parts but it is what it is and will be fixed when I have time

## Known Issues
- colission currently not implemented for flowing parts ie the sleves and viel, there will be clipping until I figure out how to properly add collisions!

## To do
- Add collisions

## Credits and stuff
- Skin modeled and based off of https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2e/e4/12/2ee4129592af87b051f1a014eb2c6c91.jpg
