## Mod Overview
- Commission skin made for Bell. This mod is a skin for bandit that changes his appearance to Violet Evergarden from the anime of the same name. Includes a custom gun model as well that replaces the bandits normal shotgun!

## Known Issues
- there will be some clipping with the Skirt frills (on the backside) that will be tweaked later depending on severity (please contact me if the clipping issue is agredious my testing showed it was minimal).
- As of now the items might be misaligned on the model as they were originally meant for bandit, until I can figure out how to manually change this you can use this [mod](https://thunderstore.io/package/KingEnderBrine/PartialItemDisplay/) to blacklist annoying items visually.
