# Credits and Thanks

Thanks to [KJ](https://twitter.com/King_Jion) for the initial concept art that the mod was inpired from, you can see it in the album linked above.
Thanks to KingEnderBrine for the Skin Builder unitypackage, Custom Skin Tutorial, and the 2B mod which was the first working instance of additional Dynamic Bones attatched to a default character skin.
None of this would have been possible without them.
