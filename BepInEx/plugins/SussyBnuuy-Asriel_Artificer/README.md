## Info
This mod adds a few skins for Artificer that make her look like Asriel Dreemurr, from Undertale. Three variants are included; God of Hyperdeath, GoH without cape, and a well-adjusted "good ending" version of the character.

The models used were created by medicin3 on gumroad. I made the tail using blender.

## Asriel

    You know... I don't care about destroying this world anymore.
    After I defeat you and gain total control over the timeline...
    I just want to reset everything. All your progress..
    Everyone's memories. I'll bring them all back to zero!

    Be careful in the outside world, OK?
    Despite what everyone thinks, it's not as nice as it is here.
    There are a lot of Floweys out there.
    And not everything can be resolved by just being nice.
    Don't kill, and don't be killed, alright?
    That's the best you can strive for.
