## Info
This skin mod makes Void Fiend into Pepsi Man! He was basically already Pepsi Man, though.

The model used is ripped from the 1999 Playstation game <i>Pepsiman</i>.

## Origin
Pepsiman, or Pepsi Man, is a superhero mascot for PepsiCo that had the power to deliver the beverage to those in need. He appeared in a total of 13 Pepsi commercials and several video games.


## Installation

I recommend getting R2modman.

To install manually, follow these instructions:

1. Download & install BepInExPack

2. Extract the .dll file into the \Risk of Rain 2\BepInEx\plugins folder

3. All good to go! Go share the crisp, refreshing flavour of Pepsi with Petrichor V.
