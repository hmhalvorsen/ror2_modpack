## Info
This is a commissioned skin mod that makes Mercenary look like Sephiroth's low-poly model.

The model used was ripped from the 1997 title <i>Final Fantasy 7</i>

## One-Winged Angel

     There was one SOLDIER named Sephiroth, who was better than the
     rest, but when he found out about the terrible experiments that
     made him, he began to hate Shinra. And then, over time, he began
     to hate everything.
