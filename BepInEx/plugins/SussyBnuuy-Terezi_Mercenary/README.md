## Info
This is a skin mod that makes Mercenary look like Terezi Pyrope, from Homestuck.

The model used was made by the_regressor on sketchfab.

## Your name is TEREZI PYROPE.

You are pretty enthusiastic about dragons. But you have a PARTICULAR
AFFECTION for their COLORFUL SCALES, which you gather and use to
decorate your hive. Though you live alone, deep in the woods, you
surround yourself with a variety of plushie pals known as SCALEMATES.
You often spend your days with them in rounds of LIVE ACTION ROLE
PLAYING. You used to engage in various forms of MORE EXTREME
ROLEPLAYING with some of your other friends before you had an
accident.


You take an interest in justice, holding particular fascination for
ORCHESTRATING THE DEMISE OF THE WICKED. You have taken up study of
BRUTAL ALTERNIAN LAW, and surround yourself with legal books. You have
no need for copies printed in TROLLBRAILLE, because you can SMELL AND
TASTE THE WORDS. You hope one day to join the honorable ranks of the
LEGISLACERATORS. Your trolltag is gallowsCalibrator and you SP34K W1TH
TH3 NUM3R4LS TH3 BL1ND PROPH3TS ONC3 US3D.


You are presently the leader of the RED TEAM, poised to begin a
mysterious game with 5 other friends, in direct competition with
another 6 of your friends, comprising the BLUE TEAM.
