## Info
This skin mod makes Mercenary into Waluigi. Wa!!

The model used is from Fortune Street.

## Waluigi

This tall, thin, evil-looking guy seems to be Luigi's rival. He works hard at his mischief: Waluigi reportedly spent a lot of time training for his debut in Mario Tennis by honing his ability to antagonize the Mario brothers. While it's general knowledge that he's the same age as Luigi, his relationship to Wario is unclear (they are probably married).

## Installation

I recommend getting R2modman.

To install manually, follow these instructions:

1. Download & install BepInExPack

2. Extract the .dll file into the \Risk of Rain 2\BepInEx\plugins folder

3. All good to go! Enjoy playing as Waluigi!

## Known Issues

Waluigi has a couple scrunkly joints. His hands are sort of weird, but look fine if you don't focus on them too much.
