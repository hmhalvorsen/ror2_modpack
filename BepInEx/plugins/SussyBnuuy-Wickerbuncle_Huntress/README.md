## Info
This is a skin mod for huntress featuring Bnuuy the wickerbuncle. Three skins are included, and any can be toggled off in the config if you'd like to hide them.

The base model used is a modified version of Jin A's Wickerbeast King.

## Wickerbuncle

A wickerbuncle is a hybrid between a wickerbeast and a carbuncle. The tail is crinkly!
