# Info

Latch - Recently promoted to Captain of the UES 'Easy Prey', travels the cosmos to find new planets to play ball.

Adds a skin for Captain turning him into the cyborg croc from Lethal League Blaze!

Mostly an excuse to give Captain a tail

# Installation

R2modman is recommended. 
Manual:
1 - Download and install BepInExPack and R2API 
2 - Extract the "CaptainLatch" dll to your plugins folder
3 - Load Game, pick a god, and pray

# Known Issues

This is a somewhat early build with a few minor things I plan to resolve later on
1. Hand animations are a little wack at times, clipping through his sleeves
2. Gun animation is Latch's hand, causing his hand to spin around, not too bad but might be a better way
3. Tail clips through ground often, may not be an easy way to rectify this
