# Info

The....uhhh, Dragon thing from the super obscure game "Attack of the Friday Monsters! A Tokyo Tale" as a skin for Engineer

Gonna be honest I've never played this game before, the design of this guy looked cool and I was like "Time to make you into a skin!"

Mostly an excuse to give Engineer a tail.
