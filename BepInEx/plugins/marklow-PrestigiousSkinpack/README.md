Nobody asked for it, yet here it is!
**The Prestigious Skin Pack.**

**NO LONGER USING RYANSKINAPI**

Adds white/gold skins to **all** of the vanilla survivors!
Get the loot and eat some froot with this *shiny, glowy, squeaky clean*, ***prestigious* skin pack!

**TURN ON BLOOM WHEN USING THIS SKINPACK**

Jokes aside, I put a lot of effort and passion into these skins and I hope everyone likes them :D
