Okina Matara from Touhou Project for Risk of Rain 2. I've largely fixed most of the issues in the (now deprecated) first release. There may be a few small clipping issues here and there, or items sticking to her in unintended ways, but, largely, these should be fixed. I'll try to do as many Touhou Project skins for Risk of Rain 2 as I can, so, if you have any suggestions or tips to help me get better in Blender, please don't hesitate to dm me in discord.
