# Changelog
- 1.1.0: Added a new skin for the walker turret (Why would you use that, anyway? Bungus is life).
- 1.2.0: Added the monsoon skin, tweaked the mesh of the standard turret a bit.
- 1.2.1: No longer broken from update.

# Known Issues

- The monsoon skin's mines and turrets will have the default skins on the character select screen. They will appear in game.
