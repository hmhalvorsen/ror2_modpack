# Fem Commando
My first mod, now updated to work with the Anniversary update, and without any api dependencies! Should be compatible with just about everything (at least until the next RoR2 update). Adds two fem skins for the commando, allowing you slide n shoot guns like atomic blonde lol. Highly polished, and includes badass Hornet version. I have figured out how to make the mastery requirement work, but I haven't implemented it yet. That means you'll still have the fem Hornet unlocked by default. For now.

# Todo
- implement mastery requirements once I've made sure they're safe via playtesting. Don't wanna wipe anyone's save lol.

# Contact
Send me feedback on discord plz (Liamono#1206).

# Changelog
- 1.0.0: Added.
- 1.0.1: fixed typo.
- 1.1.0: 
-Migrated to EnigmaticThunder 0.1.1, for compatibility with anniversary update.
-Changed store icon.
- 1.2.0: Removed EnigmaticThunder dependency (yay!). 

# Known Issues
- Items won't be positioned/sized perfectly on the body when using the skins (duh). Especially predatory instincts lol. Don't worry, it's just cosmetic.
- The female Hornet will be unlocked even if you don't have Commando:Mastery. Don't worry, it doesn't affect your achievements or anything else. But you won't use the Hornet if you haven't earned it, right? Have some honor plz.
