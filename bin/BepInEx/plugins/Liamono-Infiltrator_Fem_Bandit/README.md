# Infiltrator Fem Bandit (beta)
Adds a sleek female assassin skin to bandit, now with refined weight paint and a futuristic pistol model based on concept art from X̌ͣ̀ (X̌ͣ̀#4820). Now you can feel like a real sci-fi assassin, sneak up behind enemies and assassinate them with a high-tech pistol lol. Will be updated for improvements.

# Todo
- Remove/hide the tiny brown cube. It's been bothering a lot of people and I promise it will be gone next update.
- reshape/replace shotgun. 
- possibly recolor or modify head. It's not bad, but I think I can do better.
- probably at least monsoon-textured version. Possibly monsoon mesh.

# Contact
Send me feedback on discord plz (Liamono#1206). Especially if it isn't working or something.

# Changelog
- 0.0.1: Added
- 0.5.0: various
-New pistol model, based on concept art from X̌ͣ̀. Way more suitable for the infiltrator than the default revolver imo, let me know what you think.
-Modified head mesh to look a bit like a bandit mask. 
-improved weight paint on just about everything. BUT kept the fortnite bobbing to avoid screwing up the delicately weight-painted tubes. Plus it kinda fits the RoR2 theme.

# Known Issues
- There is a tiny brown floating cube. I'll definitely get rid of it or hide it next update lol.
- Items won't be positioned/sized perfectly on the body when using the fem skin (duh). Don't worry, it's just cosmetic.
- Some of the Bandit's meshes don't switch back when you switch to the vanilla skin, but like other similar cases, it's only a temporary bug and goes away as soon as you start a game or switch characters.
