# About
(2022/1/4) UPDATE! Happy new year! As requested, I re-added the original version - without the decal - as an additional skin slot

Original skin by [bruh](https://thunderstore.io/package/bruh/CaptainUnderglow/), got his approval.

I removed the RyanSkinApi dependency and added the Dai-Gurren Brigade logo from Gurren Lagann to the cape, for extra drip
