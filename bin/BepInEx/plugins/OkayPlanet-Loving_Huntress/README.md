#Overview
This is a skin that I decided to make just because.
It was my first time making a skin and it was fun and irritating but enjoyable overall.
Couldn't reskin the cape the way I wanted to but oh well it's fine.
The hands are fucky, because that is the way the base model for huntress is in game, so leave me alone on that.

Thanks to everyone who helped me in the Risk of Rain 2 Modding Discord
