#Ziggy the Otter
- Just another fursona skin! This one is for Captain, changing him into my otter OC, Ziggy. Features a lot of jiggle physics (tail, hair, etc)!
- 1.2.0 Update: Now has clothes! The placeholder speedo is still playable as a skin though.
- 1.3.0 Update: Tail and hair now in a natural default pose.
- The character Ziggy the Otter belongs to me. Model and texture made by me (except his gun hand).

#To Do
- Currently there are some issues where the head and pelvis areas jiggle around because of the dynamic bones attached to them. I'm looking into it, but for now enjoy the hilariously wiggly buttcheeks.
- Improving the default tail animation
- If you come across any problems/glitches or have any suggestions, let me know on discord at Otter#8609!
