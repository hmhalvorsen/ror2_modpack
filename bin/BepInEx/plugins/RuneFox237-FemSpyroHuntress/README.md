# Credits and Thanks

Model/Render by Rysonanthrodog

Thanks to KingEnderBrine for the Skin Builder unitypackage, Custom Skin Tutorial, and the 2B mod which was the first working instance of additional Dynamic Bones attatched to a default character skin.
None of this would have been possible without them.
