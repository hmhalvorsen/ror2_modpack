# Suppressive Fire Commando
At first, the mod just removed Commando's body and made it just 2 floating guns but now it adds skins like that for most survivors.

Funny story on why I decided to make this mod: so basically I was trying to make another skin mod and upon loading into the game I was just met with 2 floating guns and my 1 braincell did the funny and made it an actual mod.

  <summary>Mul-T, Rex, Void Fiend</summary>

disabled by default because of jank 
(Mul-T as it only works while p-mode is active)
(Viend as it still includes part of its chest and only has the m2 arm)
(Rex as the animations and other stuff are broken)
