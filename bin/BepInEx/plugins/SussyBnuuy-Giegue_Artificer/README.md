## Info
This mod adds a skin for Artificer of the universal cosmic destroyer, Giegue (sounds like "geeg"). It is an alien invader and the final boss from the 1989 NES game <i>Mother</i>.

The model was made by me in Blender.

## "Stop singing!"
    "Yes... that's right. That is the song. Oh! Giegue! I loved him... I loved him, as if he was
    my own child... He was always wagging his tail, just like a pup... EXCEPT for when I tried to
    SING him lullabies... Ahhh...George! This is your wife, Maria. I'm coming to join you, my 
    purpose is complete..."
    â€” Queen Mary
