## Info
This mod makes Acrid into Hagrid, from the Harry Potter universe. If you ever wanted to see the half-giant jump around and vomit acid onto aliens, now's your chance!

The model used is from the PC version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

## Hagrid
    Hagrid: You're a lizard, Harry.

(Harry looks confused)

    Harry: I-I'm a what?

    Hagrid: A lemurian. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager.

## Installation

I recommend getting R2modman.

To install manually, follow these instructions:

1. Download & install BepInExPack

2. Extract the .dll file into the \Risk of Rain 2\BepInEx\plugins folder

3. All good to go! Enjoy my hideous lil homunculus!

## Known Issues

Hagrid has low quality, single-sided textures on his hair. He also has no textures on his butt.
