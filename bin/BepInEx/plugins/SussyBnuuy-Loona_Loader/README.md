## Info
A commissioned skin mod that makes Loader look like a thicc version of Loona from Helluva Boss. Includes 4 outfits (Default, Jacket, Classy, and Underwear).

I made the underwear. The arms were made from a mixture of base loader, TF2 Sniperbot, and some original components. These processes were performed in Blender.

The base model and all outfits but the underwear were made by Teiozemo. You can find them for sale here: https://teiozemo.gumroad.com/l/Loona
