## Info
This commissioned skin mod makes Captain into a Mama-Gen. That's like a cyborg wolf, but unreasonably caked up.

The model used is the Ghostly [Mama-Gen] available on Gumroad. The gun model is the sonic blaster from the 2011 PC game <i>Doctor Who: The Adventure Games</i>.

## BODE

This mod has a base skin (default [Mama-Gen]) plus two variants, Dodgeball and Lapis. Lapis' custom texture was created by IzzyAzura~.
