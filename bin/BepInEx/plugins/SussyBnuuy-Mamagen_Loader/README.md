## Info
This skin mod makes Loader into a Mama-Gen. That's like a cyborg wolf, but unreasonably caked up.

The base model for the mamagen is the Ghostly [Mama-Gen] available on Gumroad. I made the arms from splicing TF2's MedicBot arms with components from the Mama-Gen base.

## BODE

This mod comes with a base skin and four variants. Dodgeball, Cotton Candy, Mocha, and Lapis. Cotton Candy's colour scheme was done by Logan_Man321 and Lapis was commissioned work.
