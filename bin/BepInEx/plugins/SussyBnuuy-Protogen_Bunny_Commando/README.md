## Info
This skin mod makes Commando into a cute, rabbit-like Protogen. Her name is Styptic. This model has ear and tail dynamics! :3c
There are two other texture swaps included. The fox-like one is named Nut, and the space-themed one is Cosmic.

The base model for the protogen is the well-known VRChat model made by NKD. The bunny's guns are Max's luger, from <i>Sam & Max Season 1 (Sam & Max Save the World)</i>. The other guns are the N-Zap from <i>Splatoon 2</i>.

## Mixed Blessing

The imprinting had left its mark, that's for sure. Dutiful hands, crafted to cradle gore and mend leaks. The guiding light of a meticulously programmed mental database had all but vanished. Still, the body understood its purpose, and the heart its values.

Medical work on the UES: Safe Travels is always peaceful and simple. The maladies are a stark contrast to warzone medicine, though experience applies just the same.

A unit designed for emergency surgical work set to task in simple cuts and burns. Colds and minor infections. Therapeutic work.

The artist is nothing without the gift. But the gift is nothing without work.
