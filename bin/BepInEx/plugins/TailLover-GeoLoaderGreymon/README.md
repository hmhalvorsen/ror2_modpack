# Info

GeoGreymon through intense training has managed to find a new form of himself, GeoLoaderGreymon! This all new evolution...is basically the same as GeoGreymon except he gets cool MetalGreymon arms.

A GeoGreymon skin over Loader - Using mechanical arms taken from MetalGreymon over Loader's arms

Mostly an excuse to give Loader a tail.

# Installation

R2modman is recommended. 
Manual:
1 - Download and install BepInExPack and R2API 
2 - Extract the "GeoLoaderGreymon" dll to your plugins folder
3 - Load up the game and sacrifice your first born to ensure a smooth running experience

# Known Issues

1. The arms can look a little weird when GeoGreymon punches, this is because Loader's base animations are a bit weird themselves.
2. Hands are not animated currently
