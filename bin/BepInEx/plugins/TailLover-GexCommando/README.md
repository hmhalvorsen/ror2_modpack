# Info

This planet makes me feel like Tom Hanks with a volleyball

Gex joins as a skin for Commando! He isn't quipping right now but once I learn how to I plan to have Gex say some of his...."iconic" voicelines...

But for now...IT'S TAIL TIME

(Note - this model is an edited version of his N64 model giving him a larger tail)
