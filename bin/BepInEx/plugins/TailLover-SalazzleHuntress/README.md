# Info

The weird harem lizard pokemon joins the battle as a Huntress skin! This might be the most cursed skin I've made but I really hope you enjoy it nonetheless.

Mostly an excuse to give Huntress a tail.

Now has a shiny variant!

# Installation

R2modman is recommended. 

Manual:

1 - Download and install BepInExPack and R2API 

2 - Extract the "SalazzleHuntress" dll to your plugins folder

3 - Load up the game and submit your body to the harem lizard and then enjoy

# Known Issues

Neck kinda leans awkwardly to the left when sprinting while firing. This is due to how the animation of Huntress tilting her head looks on a character with a longer neck.

# Contact
