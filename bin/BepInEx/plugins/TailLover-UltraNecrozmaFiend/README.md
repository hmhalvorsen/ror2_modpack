# Installation

R2modman is recommended. 

Manual:

1 - Download and install BepInExPack

2 - Extract the "UltraNecrozmaFiend" dll to your plugins folder

3 - Load up the game and be blinded by the glowing dragon

# Known Issues

some weirdness from the model itself, hard to fix without ruining the issue.

Armor can vary in colour due to the body being an emission - the glow is more important in this regard in my opinion
