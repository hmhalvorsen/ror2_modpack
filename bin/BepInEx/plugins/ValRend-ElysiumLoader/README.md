# Elysium Loader Skin
Adds a new skin to Loader for those who prefer a thicker alternative for our favorite survivor. 

Loader has been lacking some skins, so I decided to add this, and maybe more to come, to the pool. Since this is my first skin, it might not have the polish I wish it to have but what can you do.
Huge thanks to 12GaugeAwayFromFace, KingEnderBrine, and Ebkr for the help.
