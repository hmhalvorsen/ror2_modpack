Machine... turn back now. The layers of this palace are not for your kind. Turn back, or you will be crossing the will of [Jod](https://c.tenor.com/PAauGocjzowAAAAd/jif-jod.gif).

Your choice is made. As the righteous hand of The Father, I shall rend you apart, and you will become inanimate once more.
